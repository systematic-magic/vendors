9. Section headers
------------------
.. _start_of_check:

Section headers should comply to below mentioned requirements in respect of order, letter case, format and spelling. Also, no variations (except for alternatives explicitly mentioned in these standards) are allowed. For example, standards have "Author contributions" section with no alternatives specified, which means that all other variations (like "Authors' contributions, Author contribution, Contribution of author, etc") are not allowed.

If you see any deviations of section naming in articles, please contact authors and check whether they agree to change section header in question in accordance with these standards.

9.1. Formats of headers must comply to the requirenments specified below. Section 9.2 contains section order for each article type with the applicable format specified.
